Q-1 Give a real world example that requires sorting or a real world example 
that requires computing a convex-hull?

A- Sorting is required everywhere from daily lifestyle to heavy office works.
Sorting means arranging items or even humans in a particular order.
Like in school students are sorted on the basis of marks and grades.
In sports players are sorted on the basis of their runs,goals,etc.

Convex Hull algorithm has various examples too :

1.)Shapes of objects can be classified by their "convex deficiency trees", structures that depend for their computation on convex hulls.

2.)Traffic and accidents are great example fro convex hull. If the convex hull of a car avoids collision with obstacles then so does the car.


Q-2 Other than speed , what other measures of efficiency might one use
in  a real-world setting?

A-  a. Computer memory 
    b. Network usage 


Q-3 Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and imitations.

A- Arrays list

Advantages:

    a. Access element in constant time.
    b. Element can be inserted in any place.

Disadvantages:

    a. Random access takes n time.
    b. Extra memory is utilized in making of index


Q-4 How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

A- Similar: Both are graph algorithms and find path.
   Difference: The shortest path algorithm needs 2 points, where as salesman algorithms needs a path between more points that returns to first point.


Q-5 Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good enough.

A- Sorting is a algorithm in real world in which only best solution will do.
   Finding the shortest path between two places as couple of meters wont matter a lot.
